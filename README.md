#### ðŸ”— _[Hotel Application API](https://node-hotel-tgrs.onrender.com/)_

The **Hotel** application is a Node.js-based system designed using the Express.js framework, leveraging MongoDB as the primary database and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool. It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing personnel (staff) details and menu items within a hotel setting. The application is equipped with robust APIs that facilitate seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both personnel and menu items, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

### Technologies Used:

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, facilitating the building of APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing schema validation and modeling.
- **Local Authentication**: Implemented using Passport.js for managing authentication via username and password.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) used for authentication and authorization purposes, providing secure access to APIs.
- **Password Hashing**: Utilized bcrypt for securely hashing and storing user passwords.

This project demonstrates best practices in Node.js development, emphasizing scalability, security, and efficient data handling through modern web technologies.
